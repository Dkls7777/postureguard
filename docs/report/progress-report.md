## Step 1: Dev environment

Environment: WSL2, Ubuntu 26.04, on Windows.

Installed and verified:
- Node.js v22.22.1
- npm 9.2.0
- Docker Compose v2.40.3
- Python 3.14.4
- Git 2.53.0

Notes: reset a forgotten WSL sudo password from Windows PowerShell using "wsl -d Ubuntu -u root" then "passwd". Installed docker-compose-v2 and nodejs from apt.

## Step 2: Project scaffolding and first commit

Actions:
- Created project at ~/projects/postureguard
- git init on branch main
- Created docs structure: blog-notes, security, screenshots, report
- Added .gitignore, README.md skeleton, day-1 blog note
- First commit: a14912c

## Step 3: PostgreSQL via Docker Compose

Actions:
- Wrote docker-compose.yml (Postgres 16, healthcheck, named volume, port 5432)
- Added .env (gitignored secret) and .env.example (committed template)
- Wrote db/init/01-schema.sql: organizations, users, sessions, domains, scans, findings
- The scans table doubles as a job queue (status queued/running/done/error) for SKIP LOCKED polling
- Started the container: docker compose up -d, container healthy
- Verified the 6 tables were auto-created on first boot
